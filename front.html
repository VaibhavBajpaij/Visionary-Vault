        <h2>Design Thinking Process</h2>
        <p>
            The Design Thinking process is a structured yet flexible methodology that promotes innovation and problem-solving by focusing on human needs. Here's an overview of its key stages:
        </p>
        <div class="process-steps">
            <div class="step empathize">
                <h3>Empathize</h3>
                <p>
                    Understand the users and their needs through observation, interaction, and immersing yourself in their experiences. This stage involves gathering deep insights into the user's challenges and motivations.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step define">
                <h3>Define</h3>
                <p>
                    Clearly articulate the problem you want to solve. Based on the insights from the empathize stage, create a problem statement that focuses on the user's needs and helps to frame the challenge.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step ideate">
                <h3>Ideate</h3>
                <p>
                    Generate a wide range of ideas and potential solutions. Encourage creative thinking and brainstorming to explore various possibilities without judgment. This stage aims to come up with as many ideas as possible.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step prototype">
                <h3>Prototype</h3>
                <p>
                    Create tangible representations of the most promising ideas. Prototyping allows you to explore different solutions quickly and inexpensively, making it easier to test and refine concepts.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step test">
                <h3>Test</h3>
                <p>
                    Evaluate the prototypes by testing them with real users. Gather feedback and learn from their interactions with the prototypes. This stage helps identify what works, what doesn't, and how the solutions can be improved.
                </p>

    <h1 class="designer-title">Designer Mindset</h1>
    <h2 class="section-title">Empathy</h2>
    <p class="empathy-description">Empathy is at the heart of design thinking. Designers strive to understand the feelings, experiences, and needs of the users they are designing for. This involves active listening, observation, and immersing themselves in the users' world.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Curiosity and Open-Mindedness</h2>
    <p class="curiosity-description">A designer's mindset is characterized by a natural curiosity and a willingness to explore new possibilities without preconceived notions. Designers ask questions, challenge assumptions, and seek to uncover deeper insights.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Embrace Ambiguity</h2>
    <p class="ambiguity-description">Designers are comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity. They understand that the path to innovative solutions is not always clear-cut and are willing to navigate through complexity and adapt as needed.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Collaboration</h2>
    <p class="collaboration-description">Design thinking thrives on collaboration. Designers work in multidisciplinary teams, valuing diverse perspectives and leveraging the collective expertise to generate richer ideas and solutions.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">Experimentation and Iteration</h2>
    <p class="experimentation-description">A willingness to experiment, prototype, and iterate is crucial. Designers quickly create prototypes, test them with users, gather feedback, and refine their ideas. This iterative process helps in evolving and improving solutions.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section-title">User-Centered Focus</h2>
    <p class="user-centered-description">Designers maintain a strong focus on the user throughout the process. Every decision made is aligned with the goal of enhancing the user experience and addressing their needs effectively.</p>
